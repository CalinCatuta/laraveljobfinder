# Here's what happens step by step:

-   In header.blade.php, we use `<x-button-link>`, which refers to the ButtonLink component.
-   Laravel looks for the ButtonLink component in `app/View/Components/ButtonLink.php`.
-   The render() method inside ButtonLink.php specifies that it should return the view components.button-link.
-   Laravel then loads `resources/views/components/button-link.blade.php` and renders it.
-   The final output of `button-link.blade.php` appears inside header.blade.php.
-   So yes, when header.blade.php calls `<x-button-link>`, Laravel processes the component and renders button-link.blade.php.

**resources/views/components//header.blade.php**

-   When we want to use button-link.blade.php component, we call it like this ↓

```html
<x-button-link url="/jobs/create" icon="edit" :block="true"
    >Create Job</x-button-link
>
```

-   This will make a call ↓

**app/View/Components/ButtonLink.php**

```php
  /**
     * Get the view / contents that represent the component.
     */
    public function render(): View|Closure|string
    {
        return view('components.button-link');
    }
```

-   This will return ↓

`resources/views/components/button-link.balde.php`
